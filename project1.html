    <h3> Project Overview</h3><br>
    <p>Airbnb is an online hostel which allows individuals to rent out their properties to others for a certain amount of time. Unfortunately Airbnb is a contributor to many over arching issues such as gentrifying neighborhoods and driving out local communities with Airbnbs. This is largely due to the lack of regulations that Airbnb has. Earthcnc is an ethical extension to Airbnb that determines how ethical an Airbnb is and gives each listing a rating based upon an Ethical Index. This extension also includes a community forum that allows the renters to see what is happening in the community and the community to address their concerns relating Airbnbs in the area.</p>

    <h6> App Mockup</h6><br>
    <h3>Ethical Index</h3><br>
    The Ethical index is a scale that gives an AirBnb listing an ethical rating that is based upon racial, housing price, and median income changes between 2010 and 2020 in that area and the number of properties owned by the AirBnb poster. This ethical rating determines how gentrified a certain area is and how an AirBnb affects that area. The listing will receive a score of 0-4 based upon these 4 criteria with the potential to earn up to 4 points for each criteria. These 4 criteria include: change in race demographics, change in the median income and change in the price of housing.
