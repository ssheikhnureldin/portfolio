    <h3>Design Thinking Process</h3><br>
    <b>Problem Statement</b><br>
    (1) How to create a social media presence that spotlights the everyday normality and likeness of the people currently and previously incarcerated to those outside the system and
    <br>
    (2) How to help those individuals who are currently or have been incarcerated in finding resources, community, and housing as they re-enter society.
    <br>
    <b>Frame of Inquiry</body></b><br>
    How might we create a platform for incarcerated individuals So that we can re-humanize them and their experiences
    In order to provide equality in the courtroom and in life after incarceration.<BR>
        <br><h3>Research Process</h3><br>

      Our inital research consisted of scouring the internet for information on podcasts, articles, and previous interviews that pertained to bringing awareness and light to the experiences of incarcerated individuals both during and after their time in the system.One of the podcasts we looked at directly was the Life After Prison following individuals who have experienced the Alabama prison system. The two most significant podcasts are as follows: Part One:
Ex-offenders Face Many Challenges When Reentering Society
and Part Three:
Ex-felons Often Struggle to Find a Job
Our outreach efforts led us to landing an interview with an esteemed prison social media activist named Colin Rea. Through our conversation with Colin, as he is himself a previously incarcerated individual, we were able to ask direct user questions about not only his time and experiences within the system but also his thoughts on the app and social media presence we sought to create.
